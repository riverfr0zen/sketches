Exploration with bezier curves and displacement. There is a ["glitchy" variant here](hilo_glitchy.html).

This is still a work in progress. Mobile controls are currently unavailable.

UPDATE: Added shader to some strips, adapted from [horizontal city on ShaderToy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3tKyzG)

Desktop controls:

* Press "R" to shuffle parameters
* Press "D" to highlight displacement
* Press "S" to toggle auto-shuffle
* Press "P" to pause
